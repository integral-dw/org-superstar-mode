If your problem causes something visual (e.g. a bullet not showing/showing incorrectly), be sure to provide a screenshot and ideally the name of the font you are using.  To inspect details about how Emacs presents a given character, navigate towards it and enter either `C-u C-x =` or `C-u M-x what-cursor-position`, which will provide us with plenty of information regarding how Emacs set up the affected character for display.  __Be sure to delete this text before submission!__
