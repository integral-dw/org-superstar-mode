;;; Commentary:

;;  Prettify headings and plain lists in org-mode.  This package is a
;;  direct descendant of ‘org-bullets’, with most of the code base
;;  completely rewritten (See https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets).
;;  Currently, this package supports:

;; * Prettifying org heading lines by:
;;   + replacing trailing bullets by UTF-8 bullets
;;   + hiding leading stars, customizing their look or removing them
;;     from vision
;;   + applying a custom face to the header bullet
;;   + applying a custom face to the leading bullets
;;   + using double-bullets for inline tasks (see org-inlinetask.el)
;;   + (optional) using special bullets for TODO keywords
;; * Prettifying org plain list bullets by:
;;   + replacing each bullet type (*, + and -) with UTF-8 bullets
;;   + applying a custom face to item bullets
;; * Gracefully degrading features when viewed from terminal

;; This package is heavily influenced by (and uses snippets from) the
;; popular package "org-bullets", created by sabof.  It was made with
;; the goal of inheriting features the author liked about org-bullets
;; while being able to introduce compatibility-breaking changes to it.
;; It is largely rewritten, to the point of almost no function being
;; identical to it's org-bullets counterpart.

;; This package is versioned using (the author's understanding of)
;; semantic versioning: "<major>.<minor>.<patch>".
;; <major> version increments signify backward incompatible changes.
;; <minor> version increments signify backward compatible but
;;         significant changes.
;; <patch> version increments signify changes not affecting the API.

;; Here are some Unicode blocks which are generally nifty resources
;; for this package:
;;
;; General Punctuation (U+2000-U+206F): Bullets, leaders, asterisms.
;; Dingbats (U+2700-U+27BF)
;; Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows (U+2B00-U+2BFF):
;;     Further stars and arrowheads.
;; Miscellaneous Symbols (U+2600–U+26FF): Smileys and card suits.
;; Supplemental Arrows-C (U+1F800-U+1F8FF)
;; Geometric Shapes (U+25A0-U+25FF): Circles, shapes within shapes.
;; Geometric Shapes Extended (U+1F780-U+1F7FF):
;;     More of the above, and stars.
